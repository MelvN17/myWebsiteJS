                        <h2>Summary of a Japanese old story, Momotaro</h2>
                        <p>Long, long ago, in some place there was an old man and an old woman.<br>
                            When the old man went to the mountain to cut trees, the old woman went out to
                            the river to wash clothes.<br>
                            It happened one day, while the old woman was washing clothes at the river, a
                            huge peach floated up. (The state is described “Donburako, Donburako” in
                            Japanese.”<br>
                            The old woman was happy, and took the peach home.<br><br>
                            When the old man and old woman tried to cut this peach to eat it, a baby boy
                            jumped out from the peach.<br>
                            They thought that this must be a present from our god because they have no
                            kids. Together they gave the name "Momotaro" to this child, and brought him up
                            with so much care.<br>
                            Momotaro quickly became large and came to be very powerful.<br><br>
                            Then one day, Momotaro said, “I am going to Devil's Island to get rid of the
                            devil.”<br>
                            The old woman made millet dumplings for him.<br><br>
                            In the course of his trip, Momotaro met a dog.<br>
                            " Mr. Momotarou, where are you going?"<br>
                            "To devil's island to get rid of the devil."<br>
                            "So please give me one of the millet dumplings, and I will be your attendant."<br>
                            A dog got it, so he joined his party.<br><br>
                            Momorato continued to go with the dog, and he met a monkey.<br>
                            “Mr. Momotarou, where are you going?"<br>
                            "To devil's island to get rid of the devil."<br>
                            "So please give me one of the millet dumplings, and I will be your attendant."<br><br>
                            Momorato continued to go with the dog and the monkey, and he met a pheasant. <br>
                            “Mr. Momotarou, where are you going?"<br>
                            "To devil's island to get rid of the devil."<br>
                            "So please give me one of the millet dumplings, and I will be your attendant."<br><br>
                            Momotarou took the dog and monkey and pheasant along with him,
                            finally they arrived at Devil's island.<br><br>
                            The bad devils had a great banquet with treasures and big meals stolen.<br>
                            “Everyone, let’s beat the devils!”<br>
                            The dog bit, the monkey scratched with his nails, and the pheasant pecked with
                            his beak.<br>
                            Momotaro continued cutting with his sword.<br><br>
                            Thus, Momotaro and his party got rid of the bad devils. He went back to the old
                            man and old woman house and lived happily ever after.<br></p>
